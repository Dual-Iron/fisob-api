This is a BepInEx plugin for Rain World. You need EnumExtender installed to use it.

When a centipede's shell breaks off, it sometimes becomes an item you can pick up and use as a shield.

Red centipedes will drop shields that are larger, more numerous, and more durable than those of orange centipedes.
