CentiShields is a BepInEx plugin for Rain World.

- When a centipede's shell breaks off, it sometimes becomes an item you can pick up and use as a shield.
- The shield blocks rocks, spears, and certain creature attacks/grabs. Larger shields are better at what they do.
- Red centipedes will drop shields that are larger, more numerous, and more durable than those of orange centipedes.
- For sandbox mode, orange shields are unlocked when adult orange centipedes are unlocked, and red shields are unlocked when red centipedes are unlocked.

If you're using Realm, you can install via the browser. Otherwise, download `CentiShields.dll` and `Fisobs.dll` from [here](https://github.com/Dual-Iron/fisob-api/releases/latest). You'll need EnumExtender installed too.
